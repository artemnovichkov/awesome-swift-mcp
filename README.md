# awesome-swift-mcp

We have established this repository to serve as a comprehensive directory for resources related to the MCP, including items such as prompts, servers, and innovative ideas, all specifically tailored to the context of Swift application development. Our goal is to provide a centralized location where developers can access and contribute to a growing collection of materials that enhance the use of MCP in building better Swift apps faster.

## Servers

## Prompts üë©‚Äçüî¨

Include links here to Gists that demonstrate the prompts you‚Äôve utilized with Swift-related resources through the MCP server. These examples will help illustrate how to effectively leverage Swift‚Äôs ecosystem, showcasing practical applications and inspiring others to explore the capabilities of the MCP server in their own Swift projects.
