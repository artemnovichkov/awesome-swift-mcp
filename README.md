# awesome-tuist-mcp

We have established this repository to function as a comprehensive directory for resources related to the MCP, including items such as prompts, servers, and innovative ideas, all specifically tailored to the context of application development. Our goal is to provide a centralized location where developers can access and contribute to a growing collection of materials that enhance the use of MCP in building better apps faster.

## Prompts 👩‍🔬

Include links here to Gists that demonstrate the prompts you’ve utilized with the resources provided by Tuist through the MCP server. These examples will help illustrate how to effectively leverage Tuist’s offerings, showcasing practical applications and inspiring others to explore the capabilities of the MCP server in their own projects.
